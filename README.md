--Payment preferences.
--Geographic distribution of profits.


General Insights:


While the age demographics and payment methods for both companies were notably similar, there were significant differences in profits,
customer retention, and geographic profit distribution.


Analysis of Geographic Distribution: 


The evaluation of profit distribution among the top three revenue-generating cities revealed that Yellow Cab was heavily reliant on New York City,
which contributed nearly 80% of its total profits. On the other hand, Pink Cab displayed a more balanced distribution of profits across its top cities.
A diversified profit source is typically considered more stable during regional economic downturns, thus giving Pink Cab an advantage in this area.
However, it should be noted that this metric may be a less critical determinant compared to the other categories.


Profit Analysis: 


Yellow Cab demonstrated clear superiority in this category. It reported higher total profits over the three-year period, greater annual profits,
higher profits per kilometer, and stronger profit margins per transaction.
These metrics indicate a straightforward conclusion that this aspect decisively favors Yellow Cab.


Customer Retention Evaluation: 


This analysis required a deeper look to assess how often customers returned to use each company's services over time. 
Key factors included the percentage of customers who used the service in 2016 and continued through to 2018,
as well as the average increase in the number of rides per customer over that period. 
Both indicators pointed to Yellow Cab excelling in customer retention.



Overall Assessment: 

While Pink Cab's even distribution of profits across locations is advantageous, 
Yellow Cab's stronger performance in profit generation and customer retention makes it the superior investment choice.
Given that profit and customer retention are more predictive of long-term success, Yellow Cab stands out as the better investment option.
